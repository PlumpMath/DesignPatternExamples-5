Design Pattern Examples
==========
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hckhanh/DesignPatternExamples.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hckhanh/DesignPatternExamples)

This is some of examples of **Design Patterns**. This is my work.
I has referenced to other sources to create this repos.
I create this to learn **how to use the design patterns** properly.
I always wonder that why do people use design patters to build the software?.
I thought it's not nessessary. I just use the concept of `class` and build the software by my own ways.
It's not easy to understand and take me so many times to learn. So I don't think it's a good idea to learn it.
But now, I think I can build the software better and faster with the structure of the design patters.
It make the system more strutural and more flexible. I can use my **old code** and make it more useful.

    I hope you can use it like me or even better :D
